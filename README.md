# Aldeia Animal - Vet clinic

This project was made using NextJS to create a fast statically generated website that showcases a veterinary clinic.
It was made for my cousin, which is why the whole content is in Portuguese.

I am using Strapi in order to make it easier to update and add content.

The whole website was designed (using Figma) and made from scratch by me.
